# Changelog
When upgrading to a new version, make sure to follow the directions under the "Upgrading" header of the corresponding version.
If there is no "Upgrading" header for that version, no post-upgrade actions need to be performed.


## Upcoming
### New Features
- Times are now fetched from an NTP server when possible ([#235](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/issues/235))
    - This mitigates issues with the time being off on computers running the script, which may cause failed check-ins

### Bug Fixes
- Fix some cases in which departed flights still attempt to check in ([#257](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/issues/257))

### Upgrading
- Upgrade the dependencies to the latest versions by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - [ntplib](https://pypi.org/project/ntplib/) is a now a dependency


## 7.4 (2024-04-14)
### New Features
- A [development container](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers)
configuration was added to make it easier for contributors to use GitHub Codespaces for the project
([#240](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/pull/240) by [@ankit-jha](https://github.com/ankit-jha))
- Screenshots of the browser can now be taken at different stages in the script by running the script with the
`--debug-screenshots` argument
    - The screenshots are stored in the `logs/` directory

([#241](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/pull/241))
- Fix another case where the script would wait for headers to be set forever

### Upgrading
- Upgrade the dependencies to the latest versions by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## 7.3 (2024-03-04)
**Note**: It seems that Southwest has been refactoring their API, so updating to this
version is necessary for the script to adapt to these changes (and expect more potential issues!).

**Note 2**: Due to [#230](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/issues/230) and
[#201](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/issues/201), you may still run into issues when
running this script in Docker (although, some people have ran into this issue outside of Docker as well).

### New Features
- An official ARMv7 Docker image is now supported ([#77](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/issues/77))
- Healthchecks.io integration is added to monitor for successes and failures during fare checking
([#203](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/pull/203) by [@StevenMassaro](https://github.com/StevenMassaro))
    - For details on how to set this integration up, see the [configuration documentation](CONFIGURATION.md#healthchecks-url)
- Flight times are now displayed by the local 12-hour time in notifications
([#227](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/discussions/227))
    - Times can be changed to 24-hour format using the [notification_24_hour_time](CONFIGURATION.md#notification-24-hour-time)
    configuration option

### Bug Fixes
- Fix passwords not being input correctly into Southwest's login page
([#223](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/issues/223))
- Fix an index error during fare checking that resulted in either a crash or monitoring of the wrong flight
([#224](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/issues/224))
- Fix pop-ups on the Southwest website from interfering with logging in
([#226](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/issues/226))
- Fix an issue with script logging not working in some cases on Windows

### Upgrading
- Upgrade the dependencies to the latest versions by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## 7.2 (2024-02-07)
**Note**: Due to [#201](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/issues/201), the Docker image is currently
failing to log in to accounts and check in to flights. The workaround for now is to run the script locally with Python,
if possible

### New Features
- Added environment variable alternatives for many configuration items
([#210](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/pull/210) by [@joewesch](https://github.com/joewesch))
    - Details on how to configure environment variables can be found in the [Configuration documentation](CONFIGURATION.md)

### Bug Fixes
- Fix failed logins not reporting the correct error
([#189](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/issues/189))
- Handle flight departure time changes *mostly* correctly
    - If a flight is rescheduled within the retrieval interval (default is 24 hours) of the check-in, the flight is still
    not handled correctly. See [#199](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/issues/199)
- Don't notify check-ins for lap child passengers
([#205](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/pull/205) by [@pcarn](https://github.com/pcarn))

running this script

### Improvements
- Ensure the chromedriver version always matches the downloaded browser version
([#172](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/issues/172))

### Bug Fixes
- Fix logging in not always submitting Southwest's login form correctly. Thanks to [@bradzab0623](https://github.com/bradzab0623)
for help fixing this issue

([#177](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/issues/177))

### Upgrading
- Upgrade the dependencies to the latest versions by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- If you are using Python 3.7, the script still works. However, it is officially unsupported and therefore recommended to upgrade
to a newer version


## 6.1 (2023-09-28)
### Improvements
- Flights are now identified by their flight number, ensuring the correct flight is referenced when checking fares and scheduling check-ins

### Bug Fixes
- Fix a 'Too Many Requests' error when using Docker
([#159](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/issues/159))


## 6.0 (2023-09-23)
### New Features
- [SeleniumBase](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase) is now used as the script's browser framework. This has brought a
lot of changes to the script, mostly through performance improvements
- Specifying your [browser's executable path](CONFIGURATION.md#browser-path) can now be done in the configuration
    - Allows you to use other browsers besides Chrome and Chromium (such as Brave)

### Improvements
- Fares will now be checked for flights by default (`check_fares` does not need to be specified as `true` in your `config.json`
for fares to be checked now)
- Integration tests were added to further increase the reliability of the script

### Bug Fixes
- Fix logging in failing on Chrome v117+ (fixed by SeleniumBase)

### Upgrading
- Upgrade the dependencies to the latest versions by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - You may want to recreate your virtual environment as `undetected_chromedriver` and `seleniumwire` were removed
- Both `chrome_version` and `chromedriver_path` have been removed from the configuration. SeleniumBase now automatically
handles downloading the correct driver, so you don't need to worry about having a version mismatch
- If you do not want fares to be checked, `check_fares: false` is now needed in your `config.json`


## 5.1 (2023-08-27)
### Improvements
- Ctrl-C is now handled better on Windows systems

### Bug Fixes
- Fix issues when checking flights for multiple accounts/reservations at the same time (such as 'Text file busy')
([#138](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/pull/138) by
[@StevenMassaro](https://github.com/StevenMassaro))
    - Since these checks are now run sequentially, it may take longer on the initial startup to get
    notifications for all your check-ins. This does not affect the check-in process at all
- Fix authentication issue for passwords with special characters
([#140](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/pull/140) by
[@davidkassa](https://github.com/davidkassa))

### Upgrading
- Upgrade the dependencies to the latest versions by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Additional Notes
- Same day flight check-ins currently don't work for the second flight. If you have a same-day flight
(departing and return flights are within 24 hours of each other), see
[my comment](https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in/issues/135#issuecomment-1685040843) on issue #135
to test a potential fix for this issue (and report back if it worked or not)

### Improvements
- Optimized the script's entrypoint so the user is no longer required to install the requirements (besides Python)
to use the `--version` and `--help` flags. This also makes responses for those flags instantaneous

### Upgrading
Upgrade the dependencies to the latest versions by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## 1.0 (2022-12-10)

### New Features
- Many internal changes were done to improve the codebase, making the execution flow much more practical
